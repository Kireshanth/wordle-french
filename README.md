# WordlÃ© - French Vocab Memorization Game

## What is WordlÃ©?
My sister is currently learning French so I built a vocab memorization game to help her. The game is essentially a modified version of wordle where the user can generate a game with a solution from a specific category that they select (colours, animals, food etc).

## How to Play?

Bonjour and bienvenue to WordlÃ©ðŸ‘‹ To get started, choose a category and click play to create a game session. The word solution will be selected from a list of words from that specific category.

An image of the word solution is generated for each game using the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/). The user would know what the solution is in english but would need to recall the french translation to win. Enter your guess using your keyboard and hit the "ENTER" key to check.

You can also add your own words/categories or delete words from the existing word list by clicking the respective buttons on the main menu.




Choose a category and guess the word solution by typing it out using your keyboard. To assist with guessing, an image of the word is generated and displayed on screen using the Pexels API.
